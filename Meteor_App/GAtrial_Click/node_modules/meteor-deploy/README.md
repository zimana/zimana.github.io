meteor-deploy
=============

Deploy meteor applications to your own servers using SSH and SFTP.
Pull and feature requests are encouraged.


This package will deploy your meteor application in a way to be able to rollback to a previous deployment.
Basic filestructure is:
```
/<configured remote path>/<environment>/
  .payloads
    <projectName>-<deployment timestamp>
    ...
  <ProjectName> -> symlink to current deployment
  <ProjectName-previous> -> symlink to previous deployment
```

### Installation
```
npm install -g meteor-deploy
```

### Configuration
Imagine the following package.json:
```json
{
  "name": "MyCoolApp",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/xenolf/meteor-deploy.git"
  },
  "author": "azhwkd",
  "deployConfig": {
    "alpha": {
      "remote" : "192.0.0.100",
      "port": "22",
      "user": "myCoolSSHUser",
      "cert": "/path/to/my/private/key",
      "passphrase": "coolPass101",
      "remotePath": "/path/where/my/apps/should/run",
      "ref": "origin/alpha",
      "runPort": "3000",
      "rootUrl": "http://coolurl.com",
      "mongoUrl": "mongodb://localhost:27017/meteor",
      "mailUrl": "smtp://..."
    }
  }
}
```
The deployConfig node is the root of all evil.
Under it there are so called environment nodes. For every environment you want to deploy to you can add a new object
and so every environment can have its own server and credentials.
#### Standard options
* **remote** The server you want to deploy to. Has to have an SSH server with SFTP subsystem.
* **port** (Optional) The port of your SSH server. Defaults to 22 if not declared otherwise.
* **user** The username to use for the SSH connection.
* **cert** The private key file for your SSH user.
* **passphrase** (Optional) Passphrase for your SSH cert. Only needed if your cert has one set.
* **remotePath** The absolute path on the server where you want to run the app.
* **ref** (Optional) a git reference in the form of [remote]/[branch]. The git HEAD will get reset to this reference. Defaults to the latest ref.

#### Forever options
* **runPort** (Optional) If specified then this value will get passed to meteor in the PORT env var. Defaults to 3000
* **rootUrl** The url root of your application.
* **mongoUrl** (Optional) The connection string to your mongoDB. Defaults to mongodb://localhost:27017/meteor
* **mailUrl** (Optional) If your app uses mail you have to set this to a valid smtp uri.
